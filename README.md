# Web Application
 CRUD Web Application created using the Java Spring framework, Thymeleaf and Hibernate.
 
## About
This project was my first experience with the java Spring Framework and was meant to help myself better understand how creating web application with a language like 
java works. During the creation of this simple CRUD app I was able to connect my java code to a MySQL database using hibernate.
 
### How it Works
The application was generated using spring initializer through the eclipse IDE. From there the application.properties file is configured to connect hibernate with the    database
