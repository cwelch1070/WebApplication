# Web Application
 CRUD Web Application created using the Java Spring framework, Thymeleaf and Hibernate.
 
## About
This project was my first experience with the java Spring Framework and was meant to help myself better understand how creating web application with a language like 
java works. During the creation of this simple CRUD app I was able to connect my java code to a MySQL database using hibernate and display the information from the database on an HTML page with Thymeleaf.
 
## Take Aways
- Understanding of Spring, Hibernate and Thymeleaf
- Comprehension of CRUD application
- Advantages of the Spring Framework
